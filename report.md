## Based on the output of your Python script, write down several insights (minimum of 3) that you found. 

1. The total revenue generated from all recorded transactions is Rp 738,000. This figure reflects the overall performance of product sales during the analyzed period and serves as a baseline metric for evaluating future growth.
1. The product with the highest number of units sold is Air Mineral with a total of 30 units sold. Other products   with high sales volume include:
    - Pensil 2B – 25 units
    - Teh Botol – 22 units
   These products could help on cross-selling or bundling with lower-performing products
2. Keripik Kentang is the most profitable product despite lower sales volume. This suggests a higher unit price and potential positioning as a premium offering. These products are ideal for:
    -  Promote as a premium product or use for upselling  
3. Best-selling products where more than 20 products are sold, there are only 3 types out of 10, which is Pensil 2B, Air Mineral and TehBotol which means there is still room to improved product or strategy on selling, advertising overall products.


## Briefly explain the differences between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) based on your understanding from the module.

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broadest concept reffering to machine mimicing human intelligence.
2. Machine Learning (ML) is a part of AI on systems that learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
3. Deep Learning (DL) is A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks which mimics how neurons in the brain works with many layers ("deep") to handle complex tasks and large datasets.

## Imagine you are a store owner. How can you leverage AI to improve your business based on the existing sales data? Provide a minimum of 2 examples of AI implementation and briefly explain how they work.

1. Inventory Optimization
AI can analyze sales trends to determine which products need restocking and which are overstocked.
By learning from past sales volumes and timing, AI predicts the optimal stock level for each product. This reduces wasted inventory and ensures best-selling items are always available. For example based on the data products that are high in demand will be stocked more than lower demand products
2. Sales Forecasting
AI can analyze past sales data to predict future demand for each product.
By recognizing patterns and trends, AI helps businesses estimate how much of each item will likely be sold in the future.
This allows better planning for promotions, staffing, and inventory.
For example, if a product tends to sell more during holidays, AI will forecast higher demand for that period so the store can prepare in advance.
