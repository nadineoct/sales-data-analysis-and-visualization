## Overview

This project analyzes product sales data to understand product performance, total quantity sold, and revenue contribution. The workflow includes data loading, cleaning, aggregation, and visualization to generate meaningful business insights.

The analysis focuses on identifying best-selling products and understanding how revenue is distributed across different products.

This project demonstrates fundamental data analysis practices using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data and extract useful business insights.

Main objectives:
* Calculate total quantity sold per product
* Identify best-selling products
* Calculate revenue generated by each product
* Visualize product performance
* Generate summary statistics

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains product sales transaction data.

Each row represents one product entry with its sales information.

### Dataset Columns
| Column         | Description                 | Type      |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| product_name   | Name of the product        | Text      |
| category       | Product category           | Text      |
| quantity       | Number of units sold       | Numerical |
| price          | Price per unit             | Numerical |
| revenue        | Total revenue per product  | Numerical |

## Analysis Performed
The following analysis steps were performed:

### Data Loading
* Loaded dataset using pandas
* Verified structure and contents

### Data Processing
* Grouped data by product
* Calculated total quantity sold
* Calculated total revenue per product

### Data Aggregation
Created summary tables showing:
* Quantity sold per product
* Revenue per product
* Product category summary
## Visualizations Generated
The project generates the following visualizations:

### 1. Total Quantity Sold per Product
File:
```
jumlah_terjual_semua_produk.png
```
Shows the distribution of product sales volume.

### 2. Best-Selling Products (Quantity > 20)
File:
```
produk_terlaris_lebih_20.png
```
Highlights top-performing products.

### 3. Revenue per Product
File:
```
total_revenue_per_product.png
```

Shows revenue contribution of each product.

## Key Insights
From the analysis:

* Some products contribute significantly more revenue than others
* Best-selling products can be clearly identified through quantity analysis
* Revenue distribution is uneven across products
* Visualization helps identify high-performing products quickly
